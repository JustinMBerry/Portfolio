# OPEX Scanner - Relocation

## Summary

Collaborated with cross-functional teams to reverse engineer the document-opening and scanning process of an OPEX Scanner. Investigated file transfer mechanisms used by the scanner to facilitate mirroring of the process in a new office environment. The project involved in-depth analysis and documentation to understand and replicate the intricate workings of the OPEX Scanner.

## Key Responsibilities
 - Reverse Engineered OPEX Scanner document-processing workflow.

 - Identified and documented file transfer mechanisms.

## Technologies Used
Static IP Configuration: Configured static IP addresses to ensure stable functionality within the network.
Crossover Cable Connectivity: Utilized a crossover cable to establish a direct connection between the OPEX scanner and an SFTP transfer station.
