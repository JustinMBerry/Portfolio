# VDI Connectivity Project

## Overview

Led the VDI Connectivity Project to address and resolve issues related to random disconnections experienced by users on both WiFi and wired connections. This project
involved coordinating with ISPs, VDI administrators, and the Director of Infrastructure to throuroughly investigate potential causes.

## Project Objectives

1. **Issue Identification:**
   - Investigated and documented instances of users experiencing random disconnections from the VDI.
   - Analyzed the nature of disconnections, ranging from 30 seconds to 5 minutes, and their impact on user productivity.

2. **Collaboration and Coordination:**
   - Coordinated efforts with ISP providers to ensure stable and reliable network connections.
   - Worked closely with VDI administrators to understand and address potential infrastructure-related issues.

3. **Diagnostic Tools:**
   - Utilized WireShark for network packet analysis to identify irregularities and potential causes of disconnections.
   - Logged into the Aruba Control Center to check the connectivity status of users and gather additional insights.

4. **Documentation and Logging:**
   - Created and maintained an Excel log to document user names, disconnection times, and other relevant details for a comprehensive record.

5. **Resolution Implementation:**
   - Coordinated with AT&T to schedule on-site technical support.
   - Collaborated with the AT&T to overhaul network configurations and optimize VDI connectivity.

## Results and Impact

The VDI Connectivity Project resulted in improved stability and reduced instances of random disconnections for users on both WiFi and wired connections.
